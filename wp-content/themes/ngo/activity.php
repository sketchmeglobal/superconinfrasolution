                    <p class="text-justify fw-bold"> Better education is very necessary for all to go ahead in the life and get success. It develops confidence and helps building personality of a person. School education plays a great role in everyone’s life. The whole education has been divided into three divisions such as the primary education, secondary education and Higher Secondary education. All the divisions of education have their own importance and benefits. Primary education prepares the base which helps throughout the life, secondary education prepares the path for further study and higher secondary education prepares the ultimate path of the future and whole life. Our good or bad education decides that which type of person we would in the future.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify fw-bold"> You are intelligent and have a good life. Now, that is perhaps something you are gifted with or some unknown force makes you achieve your dreams. But then, you should show gratitude towards the universe because it has given you in life what you want. Donating would mean showing a sense of responsibility towards the betterment of the world. If you think that all the poverty and the problems would vanish through propagandas that are carried out by various organizations and governments, then you are not thinking in the right direction because propagandas are only ideas. In fact, you need to take the right action now. And that could be possible only when you start donating now. When you donate money, you psychologically feel motivated because mind feels happy when it gives. In fact, as the law of nature would have it, the givers will get. That means the more you give, the more you would receive. In brief, that is the law of reciprocation.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify fw-bold"> Undoubtedly, you can donate to some poor people on the street but that would not help because you need to make sure that money that goes as donation must be distributed properly. Hence, you should donate through an organization that specializes in helping the poor. Undoubtedly, there could be thousands of such organizations but you should be able to find the right and authentic organization so as to ensure that the money that goes for donation riches to the poor. It is time to be a little responsible and grateful because without responsibility you can change the world. You might go on talking about change and helping the poor but the words are not the things. In fact, if you really want to help then you should donate money to the poor.</p>
